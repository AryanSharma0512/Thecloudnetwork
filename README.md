# CI Pipeline & Workflow Guide

Welcome to the club's guide for contributing through our continuous integration (CI) pipeline. This document outlines the steps every member should follow, from ideation to pull request review.

## 1. Idea Brainstorming

- Begin every contribution by brainstorming the idea you want to pursue.
- For **small ideas** (bug fixes, patches, small feature tweaks), you can proceed directly to coding after brainstorming.
- For **big ideas** (major features, structural changes), post a quick summary in Discord and ping the president **before** you start working.
- When a larger effort is approved, create a dedicated branch in the central repository to coordinate the work.

## 2. Workflow for AI-Assisted Development

Members who plan to rely heavily on AI tools should follow this structured workflow:

1. Start by clearly brainstorming and articulating the idea on your own.
2. Explain the idea to ChatGPT and ask it to prepare a developer brief that includes:
   - Checklists
   - Deliverables
   - Step-by-step tasks
3. Use ChatGPT strictly as a planning and guidance toolâ€”**do not request direct code**.
4. Remove any emojis from ChatGPT's brief, then paste the cleaned content into Codex.
5. Use Codex to generate two or three different versions of the solution for comparison.

## 3. Implementation

- Create a separate branch named after yourself (e.g., `feature/alex-updates`).
- Develop your solution on that branch.
- Test and refine your changes until you are satisfied with the results.

## 4. Pull Request (PR)

- When your branch is ready, open a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the `main` branch.
- The admin team will review your PR and provide feedback or approval.

## 5. Notes on Tooling

- Members may use the club's ChatGPT Plus subscription to follow this workflow.
- If you already have a personal ChatGPT Plus subscription, you may use that instead.

By following these steps, we can maintain a consistent, transparent, and high-quality development process across all contributions.
